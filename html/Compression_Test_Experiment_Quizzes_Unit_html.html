<p><b>Q1.</b> Compression tests are generally performed on brittles materials-why? <br /><br /> <b>Q2.</b> Which will have a higher strength: a small specimen or a full size member made of the same material? <br /><br /> <b>Q3.</b> What is column action? How does the h/d ratio of specimen affect the test result? <br /><br /> <b>Q4.</b> How do ductile and brittle materials differ in their behavior in compression test? <br /><br /> <b>Q5.</b> What are bi-modulus materials? Give examples. <br /><br /> <b>Q6.</b> In cylindrical specimen, it is essential to keep h/d &lt; --- to avoid lateral instability due to bucking action. <br /><br /></p>
