<p align="justify">The tensile test is a test performed to know the ductility of the particular material. In practical, the test is carried out on universal testing machine (also called the UTM). When tension is applied to a particular member, the stresses are developed in the member at the centre. At a particular point of time during the testing, the member breaks.</p>
<p align="justify"><strong> Young&rsquo;s modulus:</strong> Young&rsquo;s modulus is defined as the ratio of stress to strain. It is denoted by &lsquo;E&rsquo;. 1. Young's Modulus (Modulus of Elasticity) In the region on the stress-strain curve where the stress changes linearly with the strain, the Young&rsquo;s modulus (Modulus of elasticity, E) is defined as the ratio of stress and strain. Value of the Young&rsquo;s modulus is a constant for a given material.</p>
