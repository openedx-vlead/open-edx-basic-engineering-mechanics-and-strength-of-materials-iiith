		 	    <p> 	      Procedure for the experiment is as follows. 	    </p> <p slign="justify"> 1. Measure the overall length and the diameter at about three places and take the average value of the test specimen.<br/> 2. Draw a line down the length of the test section of the specimen with a chalk; this serves as a visual aid to the degree of twist being put on the specimen during loading.<br/> 3. Select the driving dogs to suit the size of the specimen and clamp it in the machine by means of a sliding spindle.<br/> 4. Choose the appropriate range by capacity change lever.<br/> 5. Set the maximum load pointer to zero.<br/> 6. Set the protector to zero for convenience and clamp it by means knurled screw.<br/> 7. Carry out straining by rotating the hand wheel in either direction.<br/> 8. Load the machine in suitable increments, taking note of the torque and the corresponding angle of twist.<br/> 9. Plot a graph between torque and angle of twist and calculate the value of G by using the following relation </p>            <p>         <a href="http://eerc01-iiith.vlabs.ac.in/exp4/Exp-4 Torsion test.pdf" target="_blank">Read More</a>         </p>
