They are made of an elastic material formed into the shape of a helix which returns to its natural length when unloaded.             </p>              <p align="justify">             Metal coil springs are made by winding a wire around a shaped former - a cylinder is used to form cylindrical coil springs.             </p>            <p>         <a href="http://eerc01-iiith.vlabs.ac.in/exp8/Exp-8 Compression test on spring.pdf" target="_blank">Read More</a>         </p>
